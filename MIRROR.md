This repository is generated from the Despia monorepo folder `OpenSource/Engine`
(commit `b8d2260c7d0d4146e62e8049488f92be2bd994ee`).

- Please do not open pull requests here. Changes land in the monorepo, where
  the engine conformance gates run, and the next sync replaces this tree.
- `conformance/`, when present, is a vendored copy of the shared corpus that
  the Swift reference and the Kotlin kernel also run; `npm test` runs it
  standalone here.
- Tags are cut automatically when the package version changes upstream.
